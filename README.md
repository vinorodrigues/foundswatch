# Foundswatch

Foundswatch is a collection of open source themes for Foundation for Sites. Check it out at [foundswatch.com](https://foundswatch.com/).

## Usage

There are a few different ways you can integrate Foundswatch into your project.

### Via Pre-complied Asset

Download the `foundation.min.css` file associated with a theme and replace Foundation's default stylesheet. You must still include Foundation's JavaScript file to have functional dropdowns, modals, etc.

### Via CDN

Similar to above, but you can hotlink to the appropriate `foundation.min.css` hosted on [jsdelivr.com](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/gh/vinorodrigues/foundswatch).

### Via Sass Imports

If you're using Sass (SCSS) in your project, you can import the `_settings.scss` and `_foundswatch.scss` files for a given theme. This method allows you to override theme variables.

```
@import 'settings';             // *Foundswatch variant
@import '../scss/foundation';   // Zurb Foundation 6
@include foundation-everything;
@import 'foundswatch';          // *Foundswatch variant
```

Make sure to import Foundation's `foundation.scss` in between `_settings.scss` and `_foundswatch.scss`!

## Source Installation

## Customisation

Foundswatch is open source and youâ€™re welcome to modify the themes.

Each theme consists of two SASS files. `_settings.scss`, which is included by default in Foundation, allows you to customize the settings. `_foundswatch.scss` introduces more extensive structural changes.

Check out the Help page for more details on building your own theme.
